### Files
- `index.html` the "skeleton" of the website, this is the landing page and text data of what your website contains
- `main.css` is the "flesh and skin" of your website, this is where the aesthetic (colors, sizes, fonts, etc...) are defined
- `assets` is a folder commonly made that contains the images, javascript, fonts files, and documents refrenced in the website
- `favicon.ico` is the small image icon that appears at the top of the web browswer (usually next to the url)

### Getting Started
1) I recommend cloning the repo, changing the text titles and social media links to ones of your own choosing in `index.html`, changing theme colors in `main.css`, and replacing the `header.jpg` image in the `assets` folder with one of your own (keep the same file name or find where to change this :) )
2) View your website by opening the `index.html` file with your favorite web browser
